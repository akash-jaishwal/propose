# 💘 Project Analysis: Romantic Proposal Website

**Objective:**
Create an interactive, playful digital proposal experience to ask your girlfriend, "Will you be my Valentine?"

**How It Works:**
1.  **Main Page:** Displays a romantic request. The "No" button playfully evades the cursor on hover/click, displaying thought bubbles (e.g., "Soch lo!") and using collision detection to never obscure the main text.
2.  **Success Page:** Clicking "Yes" triggers a celebration with confetti and a loving message.

**Technical Stack:**
*   **HTML:** Semantic structure.
*   **CSS:** Glassmorphism design, floating heart animations, and responsive layout.
*   **JavaScript:** Handles button evasion logic, thought bubble positioning, and overlap prevention.
